##########################

# "Patterns are to be played consecutively with each performer having the freedom to determine how many
#  times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving on to the next.  There is no fixed rule
#  as to the number of repetitions a pattern may have, however, since performances normally average
#  between 45 minutes and an hour and a half, it can be assumed that one would repeat each pattern
#  from somewhere between 45 seconds and a minute and a half or longer."
